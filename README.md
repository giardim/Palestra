# Palestra
This is a senior capstone project for SUNY Polytechnic Institute which explores the topic of Internet of Things. There
are three main components:
    - Embedded systems
    - App Development
    - Networking
Each of these components will demonstrate a thourough understanding of the knowledge I obtained while attending SUNY
Polytechnic Insitute.

## Overall goal
Using an ESP32 and an MPU6050, I will gather data and send it to a server via TCP. I will also create an Android app
which will be able to pull the data from the server. The user will then be able to study motion and force.
